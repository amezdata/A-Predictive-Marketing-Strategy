# **Overview**

This project delves into the sales trends of an e-commerce company, focusing on its sales information. Through a deep analysis, it uncovers distinct behavioral patterns in consumer purchases. These patterns present a significant opportunity to implement a predictive marketing strategy aimed at enhancing sales performance and potentially increasing the company's revenue. By identifying when and what consumers are more likely to buy, the project lays the groundwork for targeted marketing efforts that align with customer preferences and behaviors, setting the stage for more effective engagement and growth.
